                        <h1>Welcome to Victoria’s Hope!</h1>

                        <p>
                        My name is Victoria Agius. I am 13 years old and am a typical teenager who loves to read and hang out with my friends. When I was 10 I started a foundation called Victoria’s Hope. This foundation is based on 2 concepts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The first is that anyone can “MAKE A DIFFERENCE”. Regardless of their age, income, status or background we are all called to be a positive change on the world around us. We can’t always depend or wait for someone else to take action. This means you!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        The second is that all proceeds go to Sunnybrook Hospital. My dad was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and successfully treated at Sunnybrook Hospital. I thought that that would be the perfect place to donate to since my dad came home safe and healthy. Cancer affects so many families, that chances are either you or someone you know have been affected by cancer. Together we can make a difference!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This all began when I started making bracelets for family and friends. I came up with the idea to sell them and donate all the proceeds to cancer research and treatment. In my first year, I raised $1,500 and donated it all to Sunnybrook Hospital. With the help of my family and friends and 2 fundraising events, Victoria’s Hope has raised a total of $41,125.00, which has all gone to Sunnybrook Hospital. I am so grateful for all of your support and generosity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        HOPE IS A SMALL WORD WITH A BIG MEANING.
                        </p>
                        <p>
